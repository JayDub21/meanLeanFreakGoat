//api keys for maps, weather, gov data, etc. are in the config.js. This is for security reasons so API keys don't get stolen.
//WHEN YOU ADD AN API KEY, ADD IT TO CONFIG.JS. 

var Gkey = config.myGKey;

var WeatherKey = config.myWKey;

//when you create the queryURLs, you use var Gkey or var WeatherKey to replace where the API key is.
